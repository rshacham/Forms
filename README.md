# 🎨 Forms

_A sketch-based puzzle-platformer bursting with colors, forms, and a whole lot of fun._

**Forms** is a video game designed and developed as part of our studies at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.

Take a journey into our sketched world of evolving shapes and playful colors.  
Jump, roll, moan — and transform — to discover the best form of yourself to solve challenges in an ever-changing environment.  

Zoom in or out, connect with your inner child, and just **have FUN**!
